                        <p>According to <a class="under" target="_blank" href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2015/04/16/research-identifies-barriers-in-tracking-meals-and-what-foodies-want/"> research done by the University of Washington and Georgia institute of technology</a>, people struggle with food journaling technology. A few key frustrations were that logging food entries took too much effort, it was time consuming, and they even felt judged while doing it.</p>

                        <p>The biggest concern I had after looking at the research was the fact that people felt judged while using the app. So I wanted to get away from having users track calories, steps, or weight. I wanted to have users build better relationships with themselves and food.</p>
                        
                        <p>My first solution was to move away from counting calories. I am not a nutritionist but there is probably more to health than calories. The next two solutions were to encourage exercise everyday and to build a better relationship with food. After focusing on physical health I thought about how to add in mental health.</p>
                        
                        <p>The result is Thrice Health. An app that encourages exercise, home-made meals, and reading an article on mental health. The app is focused on taking care of yourself everyday.</p>

                            <p>I wanted to keep the app as simple as possible. The only function it serves is to track how much sugar a person consumed in a day so I didn't want much clutter. Along with tracking sugar, the app tracks the user's steps and their weight. Deciding to include weight took some thought. While I do not believe a person's weight is the end all be all, weight loss was one of the primary reasons users used a food log.</p>

                        <p>The three triangles in the logo represent the three daily activities in the app. Most health and fitness app either have an orange or green as their primary color. Orange is normally used for fitness while green is generally used in nutrition. Orange was chosen to be the primary color as is it is often considered to be a happy and energetic color. It is not used too much in the app as orange can also be overbearing. Montserrat is the chosen typeface as it is minimal and modern while also legible when given different weights.</p>

                        <p>I think whitespace is important but a flat white just seems off, or it feels empty. That is why I had the background be an opaque blue and the main content was on the central card. Helvetica Neue is the only font used. I do try to stay away from it but I wanted as simple of an app as possible. Fewer distractions and a more user friendly interface.</p>
