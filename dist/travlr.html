An app for the travelers who are tired of looking up reviews and recommendations. TRAVLr will take up to 3 different interests and curate an itinerary for that person while also giving the traveler plenty of opportunity for spontaneous free time.</div> </div> <div class="redo rev bot4"> <div class="whitebox left"> <div class="head p">HiFi</div> </div> <div class="bodyp">I was quite happy with how the high fidelity designs came out. I chose hero images that took up the whole screens for the sign up pages to inspire the user; to make them actually want to travel. Traveling is supposed to be about experiencing new places. I chose ghost buttons so it would not take much away from the images. Avenir Next was the primary font because it's thin and still looked nice capitalized.</div> </div> <img class="photos mar2" src="/hifi.33ef01c8.svg"> <div class="redo bot4"> <div class="whitebox right"> <div class="head p">Photos</div> </div> <div class="bodyp">The choice to use full width images was to show case scenes from traveling. Traveling is all about seeing new places and taking in the culture and surrounding areas. Originally, a grid was going to be used to have more locations on the page. However, with the photography chosen it is meant to inspire you and to motivate you to travel. </div> </div> <img class="photos" src="/nyc.053553db.jpg"> <img class="photos mar4" src="/yosemite.77be1d34.jpg"> <div class="bot2"></div> <div class="redo rev bot4"> <div class="whitebox left"> <div class="head p">Colors</div> </div> <div class="bodyp">For whatever reason, color has been my biggest issue while designing. I think I like a color then I change my mind at least 20 times. However, I had noticed that red and green are used a few popular travel apps. I chose red as the primary color as it grabs attention and I personally always think of passion when I see red. I chose a yellow as the accent color for the buttons because it gave a nice contrast to the backgrounds. Green is used minimally in the sign up when a form is highlighted.</div> </div> <div class="bot2"></div> <img class="photos mar4" src="/trav_colors.9ce6c4ec.jpg">  <div class="bot3"></div> </div> <footer> <p>Nick Zart</p> <a href="mailto:nzart@g.clemson.edu">Email</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/nzart_GC" target="_blank">@Me</a> <a href="https://github.com/nzart" target="_blank">Github</a> <script src="/main.f2db69d8.js"></script> </footer> </main> <nav class="cd-3d-nav-container"> <ul class="cd-3d-nav"> <li><a href="/index.html">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about.html">About</a></li> <li><a href="/work.html">Work</a></li> <li><a href="/contact.html">Contact</a></li> </ul> </nav> <a href="#0" class="cd-top js-cd-top">Top</a> <script src="/scroll.16b59404.js"></script> </body></html>
