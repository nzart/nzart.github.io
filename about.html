            <div class="bodyp">
                Hello! My name is Nick Zart and I’m from Jacksonville, FL. 
                I am a Senior studying Graphic Communications at Clemson University. 
                I’m most likely learning, running, or perfecting the pour over. 
                I am an avid Liverpool fan as well. 
                Oh and I can make some of the best cookies in the world.
            </div>

            <div class="sectionTitle">Education</div>
            <div class="bodyp">
                I have been extrememly fortunate during my time at Clemson and I have had the opportunity to meet great people.
                I took an introductory web design and development class my sophomore year and that really set the tone for what career I wanted to pursue. 
                I have spent many hours learning as much as I can through Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, and of course through my professors. 
                I am currently learning React and I have enjoyed the process so far. 
                I believe that being a life-long learner is extremely important, and not only in web design and development.
            </div>

            <div class="sectionTitle">Work</div>
            <div class="bodyp">
                One of the reasons I recommend Graphic Communications is because you are required to have two internships to graduate. 
                I was able to intern with two great companies, one being outside Atlanta, GA and the other was in Memphis, TN. 
                Throughout both internships I truly realized the importance of communication. 
                And of course both gave me the oppurtunity to work in a team where everyone had a different role and I loved seeing everything come together. 
            </div>

            <div class="sectionTitle">Front End & UX</div>
            <div class="bodyp">    
                As mentioned, since Sophomore year I have been devoted to learning development and design. 
                Having a background in print gives me a unique view of what works and why.
                I have also been able to use my experience to understand that different people and industries have different needs. 
                I am excited for what is to come. 
                I am more than ready to join a team and really push myself. 
                The only way to get better is to get uncomfortable right?
