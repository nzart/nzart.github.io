                    </div>
                        <div class="bodyp">TRAVLr is my idea for an app that creates an itinerary for travelers who don't want to plan their trip. An app for the travelers who are tired of looking up reviews and recommendations. TRAVLr will take up to 3 different interests and curate an itinerary for that person while also giving the traveler plenty of opportunity for spontaneous free time.</div>

                    </div>
                        <div class="bodyp">I was quite happy with how the high fidelity designs came out. I chose hero images that took up the whole screens for the sign up pages to inspire the user; to make them actually want to travel. Traveling is supposed to be about experiencing new places. I chose ghost buttons so it would not take much away from the images. Avenir Next was the primary font because it's thin and still looked nice capitalized.</div>

                    </div>
                        <div class="bodyp">The choice to use full width images was to show case scenes from traveling. Traveling is all about seeing new places and taking in the culture and surrounding areas. Originally, a grid was going to be used to have more locations on the page. However, with the photography chosen it is meant to inspire you and to motivate you to travel. </div>

                    </div>
                        <div class="bodyp">For whatever reason, color has been my biggest issue while designing. I think I like a color then I change my mind at least 20 times. However, I had noticed that red and green are used a few popular travel apps. I chose red as the primary color as it grabs attention and I personally always think of passion when I see red. I chose a yellow as the accent color for the buttons because it gave a nice contrast to the backgrounds. Green is used minimally in the sign up when a form is highlighted.</div>

                        <div class="bodyp">I wanted to make an logo that represents travel as well as itineraries. Not exactly the most common combination. For one, itineraries don’t really have a set look; they can be paper, on your phone, or written down on your arm.  But I had an idea for a paper airplane as the logo and I am quite pleased with it. I decided to make the buttons ghost buttons and rounded so they don’t seem as harsh and abrupt.</div>
